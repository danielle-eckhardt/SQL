In this SQL, I am querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about the customer and order data for a hypothetical company.
Using SQLite and connected to a database from CharlotteChaze BreakIntoTech Analytics Course.

Database name: BIT_DB

Tables: 
JanSales (orderID, Product, Quantity, price, orderdate, location)
FebSales (orderID, Product, Quantity, price, orderdate, location)
MarSales (orderID, Product, Quantity, price, orderdate, location)
AprSales (orderID, Product, Quantity, price, orderdate, location)
MaySales (orderID, Product, Quantity, price, orderdate, location)
customers (order_id, acctnum)


1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT count(*)
FROM bit_db.jansales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'; 
-- 9681


2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count(*)
FROM bit_db.jansales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
AND product = 'iPhone';
-- 379

3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT c.acctnum
FROM bit_db.febsales as f
JOIN bit_db.customers as c
ON f.orderID = c.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT product, price
FROM bit_db.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;
-- AAA Batteries (4-pack) 2.99


5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? 
SELECT product, sum(Quantity)*price as total_revenue
FROM bit_db.JanSales
GROUP BY product;
-- product	total_revenue
