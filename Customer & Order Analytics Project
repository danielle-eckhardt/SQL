In this SQL, I am querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about the customer and order data for a hypothetical company.
Using SQLite and connected to a database from CharlotteChaze BreakIntoTech Analytics Course.

Database name: BIT_DB

Tables: 
JanSales (orderID, Product, Quantity, price, orderdate, location)
FebSales (orderID, Product, Quantity, price, orderdate, location)
MarSales (orderID, Product, Quantity, price, orderdate, location)
AprSales (orderID, Product, Quantity, price, orderdate, location)
MaySales (orderID, Product, Quantity, price, orderdate, location)
customers (order_id, acctnum)
