# Danielle's SQL Portfolio

 Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This code repository contains examples of SQL I've written. Feel free to take a look and reach out if you have any questions. I am always looking to expand my skills in SQL and take on new challenges to be a better data analyst. I hope you enjoy! My email is marshalldanielleann@gmail.com
