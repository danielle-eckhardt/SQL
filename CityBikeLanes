1. Let's say you work as a data analyst for your city, and your boss wants a list of all the bike lanes that have an average safety rating of 4.0 or higher.
She also wants to see the average safety rating for each of those bike lanes, and a label that says "Safe Lane".

WITH ar as
(SELECT street, avg(safetyrating) as avg_r
FROM CityBikeLanes
GROUP BY street)
SELECT street, avg_r, 'Safe Lane' as 'Label'
FROM ar
WHERE avg_r >= 4.0;
